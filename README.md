 # EEPROM 28C Programmer
**Type**: Hosted Project | **Status**: Completed

This is a home project for a simple parallel EEPROM programmer based on Raspberry PI (model 3).

It currently supports 28C16 (2Kx8), 28C64 (8Kx8) and 28C256 (32Kx8) EEPROMs, but it will probably work with all 28C-family (having all the necessary address-bus pins).

## Specifications

The hardware uses a standard Raspberry Pi 3 for its abundant GPIOs, avoiding the complexity of serial-to-parallel shift registers on the address bus.


* **Voltage Translation:** The voltage gap between the Raspberry Pi GPIOs (3.3V) and the EEPROM pins (5V) is safely managed by a TXS0108 8-bit bidirectional voltage-level translator.

* **Timing Management:** The C software currently supports single-byte operations; write cycles are managed through hard-coded delays to guarantee completion.



### Prerequisites / Requirements

To build and run this project:

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi Model 3 (or any model with enough available GPIOs), TXS0108 translator.

* **Software:** WiringPI library installed, standard GCC toolchain.


### Hardware

Schematics and PCB layouts are designed with ExpressPCB free CAD software.


#### Schematic:

### Software

The software is written in C and uses WiringPI for GPIO access, and the GNU Getopt function to automate the parsing of command-line options.


Below is the list of options with the relative allowed params, as shown in the help:

***Warn!** The software, in this release, does not check the value of the parameters, be careful.*
